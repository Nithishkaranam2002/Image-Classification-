# üçéü•¨ü•ï Image Classification - Fruits and Vegetables  
GitHub Repo: [Image Classification](https://github.com/Nithishkaranam2002/Image-Classification-/)

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with Keras to classify images of common fruits and vegetables such as apples, bananas, corn, cabbage, and chili peppers. It includes a trained model, sample images, and a simple API built using Flask to serve predictions.

## Project Overview

- Built a custom image classification model to identify different types of produce.
- Trained the model using labeled datasets and exported it as a `.keras` file.
- Developed a Flask API (`app.py`) to handle real-time predictions via image upload.
- Uploaded several sample images to test predictions.

## Model

- Model Type: CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
- Framework: TensorFlow / Keras
- Output: Predicts class labels such as `apple`, `banana`, `cabbage`, `corn`, `chilli`.
